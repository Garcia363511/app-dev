## Plot
Living in inner-city south Dublin in 1985, Conor Lalor's dad Robert[9] struggles with his architecture practice and his marriage, and drinks and smokes to excess. At a family meeting, he announces he is taking the youngest son Conor out of his expensive school and moving him to a Christian Brothers one, Synge Street CBS, which Robert asserts is of equally high repute. Conor's older brother Brendan ribs him about the change as well as about the state of the family unit.

Conor appears in his new uniform but without the regulation black shoes. School principal Br. Baxter chastises him despite Conor's pleas of being unable to afford new shoes. To avoid going shoeless, Conor paints his shoes black.

An encounter with the school bully Barry introduces Conor to Darren, an ally and budding entrepreneur. When Conor recruits aspiring model Raphina for a music video, Darren agrees to manage his band and introduces him to multi-instrumentalist Eamon.

The band practices in Eamon's living room, playing covers until Brendan encourages him to develop the band's own style. Conor writes original songs with Eamon, describing themselves as "futurists". The band films their first music video wearing comical costumes; Raphina acts as ingénue and makeup artist. Conor goes into school the next day wearing make up, and Brother Baxter forcibly removes it.

Raphina gives Conor his nickname "Cosmo", which she says is more in keeping with his new band's image. After spending the day filming a music video for a new song, Conor and Raphina kiss. He also stands up to his bully, Barry by pointing out the insignificance of both their lives, which greatly upsets Barry.

Robert and Penny's marriage falls apart while Raphina and Conor's relationship blossoms. Conor takes Raphina out to Dalkey Island in his granddad's motor cruiser. Here, they view the car ferry leaving Dún Laoghaire for the UK and discuss Raphina's dream of leaving Ireland for London.

Conor, Raphina and the band prepare to film a Back to the Future-inspired music video for their new song, but Conor is disheartened when Raphina fails to show up. She reveals that she was set to leave for London with her older boyfriend, but he abandoned her.

Hurt by her lack of disclosure and offended by her nonchalance, Conor breaks off ties with Raphina. Because of this, and his family's problems, Conor finds difficulty in writing or playing music. But Brendan urges Conor to continue so he can make a better future for himself.

Penny and Robert announce to the family that they are getting legally separated and selling the house. Penny plans on moving in with her affair and boss, Tony, whilst Robert plans on getting a small apartment. They will share custody. An opportunity arises for the band to play live at an end-of-year party at school. Conor strikes up a friendship with Barry, offering him the chance to be the band's roadie and escape his abusive family.

Conor prepares a new song mocking Baxter, which the band performs as an encore while distributing homemade masks of Baxter's face. Raphina arrives before the band finishes and reconciles with Conor. Both of them leave the party and the school in uproar.

After secretly saying goodbye to his family later that night, Conor and Raphina persuade Brendan to drive them to Dalkey, so they can escape in the motor cruiser and head to London. At the harbour, Brendan and Conor embrace. Conor and Raphina sail out to sea, following the ferry across the rough Irish Sea to a new life in London. Brendan watches them disappear into the distance and cheers, overjoyed that his younger brother has left to go on to greater things.
